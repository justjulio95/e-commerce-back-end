## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies please run the following command:

`npm i`

## Usage
To use this application, once the dependencies are installed, you will need to create a `.env` file and create the following variables: 
- `DB_NAME= ''` 
- `DB_USER= ''`
- `DB_PW= ''` 
Enter the appropriate information in the file so the connection file can read it. Once that's been done, simply run `npm start` in your terminal and the project can be interacted with through Insomnia.
